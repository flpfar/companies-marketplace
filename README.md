**Sample data**

This project contains a seeds file to provide sample data for a preview of the application. The seeds file creates a company with domain 'coshop.com', some categories and posts. After running the seeds it is possible to 'Login' with the user 'master@coshop.com' and password '123123', or 'Sign up' users with email domains 'coshop.com' (e.g. 'user@coshop.com').

- In order to use the seeds file, run in terminal: `$ rails db:seed `

### Usage

- Create a company and a category for that company (each company has its own categories) through terminal: 
```
$ rails console
> company = Company.create(name: 'Company Name', domain: 'companydomain.com')
> company.categories.create(name: 'Some category')
> exit
```

- Run `rails server` in terminal.
- Open a web browser and type ` http://localhost:3000/ ` on the address bar.
- Visit the 'Sign Up' page, create a user using a company's domain email and start playing around.

### Run tests

This project uses RSpec and Capybara for testing. In order to run the tests, type `rspec` in the terminal, inside this project folder. For more information about the running tests, use `rspec -f d`
